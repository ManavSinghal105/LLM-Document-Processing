# LLM-Document-Processing

This repository contains the Jupyter Notebook **RAG1.ipynb**, which demonstrates a **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline**.  
The notebook integrates **Large Language Models (LLMs)** with external knowledge sources to provide contextually rich and accurate responses.

---

## 📌 Features
- 🔎 **Document Retrieval** – Efficiently fetches relevant information using vector databases (FAISS/Chroma/Pinecone).  
- 🤖 **LLM Integration** – Connects retrievers with large language models for context-aware responses.  
- 📊 **Preprocessing Pipeline** – Cleans, chunks, and embeds documents for efficient retrieval.  
- ⚡ **End-to-End Demo** – From raw text data to final augmented responses.  
- 🧩 **Modular Design** – Easy to swap embeddings, retrievers, or LLM providers.  
- 📈 **Scalable Setup** – Can be extended with APIs, Docker, or cloud deployment.
