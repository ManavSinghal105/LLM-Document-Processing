However, there's a voluntary deductible (Source 0, I) of \\u20b935,000.  Subtracting the deductible from the claimable amount results in an insurer liability of \\u20b94,00,000.  However, Source 0 only provides example amounts, and doesn't explicitly state what the insured's plan is.  Source 3 shows sub-limits for joint replacements are less than the claimed amount, however, we only have the total claimed amount and not a breakdown of costs, hence we cannot definitively rule out costs associated with the replacement being part of the total claim, which would otherwise necessitate reducing the approved amount.  Therefore, given the policy is only three months old, it is assumed that the policyholder would not have accrued any additional sum insured/cumulative bonus (Source 0, I).  Therefore, given the lack of further details on cost breakdown, only the deductible will be applied.  The final approved amount is the insurer's liability after applying the deductible: \\u20b94,00,000-\\u20b94,00,000=\\u20b935,000.
